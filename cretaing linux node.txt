USING CREDENTIALS

    1. ssh USENAME AND PRIVATE KEY 
a.new node
b.creating a ssh username and private key credential (username-see the "id" or "whoami" cmd in vm that is the username)
c.first generate the key pairs(ssh-keygen -t rsa)
d.go to .ssh directory 
e.list of .ssh directory( authorized_keys,id_rsa,id_rsa.pub) with known hosts file verification strategy
f.copy the public key and add into (vi authorized_keys)
g.copy the private key and paste it in the credential configure

  2.Username and Password
a.new node
b.creating username and password credentials(before that create user and password in our vm)
c.in remote root directory give the valid path which means where we want to store regarding to jenkins information or to store artifacts(create one directory in our vm and 
give permissions(chmod 777 <directoryname> chown jenkins:jenkins <directoryname>)
d.create one .ssh directory inside /var/lib/jenkins 
e.create one known_hosts and append the inforemation of(ssh-keyscan -H hostname) ex:ssh-keyscan -H vm >> /.ssh/known_hosts


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KEYGEN AND KEYSCAN:
ssh-keygen -t rsa ---generates SSH key pairs for authentication purposes.
ssh-keyscan -H hostname--- retrieves and displays the public SSH key of a specified host, useful for adding keys to the known_hosts file for secure connections.

jnlp-java network launch protocol


1.new node
2.give the path were u want to store the artifacts in the remote windows path in remote root sirectory (ex:C:\Users\windowuser\Downloads\Jenkins)
3.launch method:launch agent connected to ir controller 
4Custom WorkDir path:same remote root directory path
5.save and launch node
6.as soon as launched the node it will show couple of commands to run in the windows cmd path  (ex:C:\Users\windowuser\Downloads\Jenkins>)
    curl.exe -sO http://104.42.60.60:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar
      java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://104.42.60.60:8080/computer/window/jenkins-agent.jnlp
       -secret d2057d8ad5af1f9ff618545c0051b73095ab1f76bfd9447f0ad27760ed74f71a -workDir "C:\Users\windowuser\Downloads\Jenkins"
7.after running the cmds in the windows cmd path ..then the window node will connect


8.but the problem is after closing the cmd prompt in winows then the windows node will disconnect
to overcome that we need to install exe document(
   a.browser the window service wrapper --open the github and click on tags 
  b.click on release and scroll down and install windowsX64.exe
  c.copy that file in the folder (ex:C:\Users\windowuser\Downloads\Jenkins>) and rename that with jenkins-agent.exe
  d.create one xml file with jenkins-agent.xml .open the jenkins-agent.xml file and paste the jenkins.xml content which present in the sample folderin
     github window service wrapper repo
  e.come to cmd prompt as a admistrator in windows and run the command jenkins-agent.exe install
  f.search for services in windowss serach bar and we can see jenkins8080 id which is specified as jenkins8080 in xml document
    g.click on and start the service it will connect without any distractions)
